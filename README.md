OOP Concepts in Python 3.12.4

Overview:

This repository is part of my journey to learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using Python 3.12.4. As a beginner Python enthusiast, I’m practicing foundational problems that demonstrate various OOP principles like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and more. This repository serves as a collection of these exercises, helping me (and hopefully others) strengthen their understanding of OOP.

Learning Journey:

As a beginner, I’m gradually exploring OOP concepts by applying them to simple, real-world problems. I started with basic class methods and attributes, then progressed through inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, eventually tackling advanced topics like abstract base classes. Each practice problem builds upon the last, helping me grasp OOP principles through practical coding.

Technologies Used:

Python 3.12.4
Python is the primary language used in this project, leveraging its flexibility and simplicity to demonstrate OOP concepts.
Practice Problems
Here are the problems I’ve worked on so far:

Class Methods and Attributes:
Learn how to define class methods and instantiate objects, using the Student class as an example.

Inheritance:
Explore inheritance by creating a base Animal class and overriding methods in derived classes Dog and Cat.

Encapsulation:
Understand encapsulation by making class attributes private and using getter and setter methods in the Student class.

Polymorphism:
Implement polymorphism with a Shape base class and derived classes Rectangle and Circle, each overriding the area method.

Class Variables vs Instance Variables:
Clarify the distinction between class and instance variables by creating a Car class with both types of variables.

Method Overloading (Using Default Arguments):
Demonstrate method overloading using default arguments in a Calculator class to sum two or three numbers.

Abstract Base Class:
Implement an abstract base class Vehicle and derive concrete classes Car and Bike that must implement the start_engine method.

Conclusion:

By working through these practice problems, I have gained a solid understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstract classes are now much clearer, and I feel confident applying these techniques in real-world projects. This learning journey has significantly strengthened my command of OOP in Python.
